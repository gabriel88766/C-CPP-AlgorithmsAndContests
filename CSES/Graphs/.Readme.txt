Counting rooms => BFS 2d
Labyrinth  => BFS 2d and store PATH
BuildingRoads => DSU, connected components
MessageRoute => BFS and store PATH
BuildingTeams => Bipartite with BFS
RoundTrip => Cyclefinding - DFS
Monsters =>  BFS
ShortestRoutesI => dijkstra
ShortestRoutesII => Floyd-Warshall

FlightDiscount => dijkstra, but with idea to change one edge, the key idea is something like problems with flows, a new copied graph with all edges being a connection between graphs with w/2 weight
Cyclefinding => bellman ford negative cycle.

RoundTripII => Cyclefinding - DFS in directed graph. (Something like this in Tarjan)
CourseSchedule => Topological Sort.
