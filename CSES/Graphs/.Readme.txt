Counting rooms => BFS 2d
Labyrinth  => BFS 2d and store PATH
BuildingRoads => DSU, connected components
MessageRoute => BFS and store PATH
BuildingTeams => Bipartite with BFS
RoundTrip => Cyclefinding - DFS
Monsters =>  BFS
ShortestRoutesI => dijkstra
ShortestRoutesII => Floyd-Warshall
High Score => Bellman ford, but not too easy idea.
FlightDiscount => dijkstra, but with idea to change one edge, the key idea is something like problems with flows, a new copied graph with all edges being a connection between graphs with w/2 weight
Cyclefinding => bellman ford negative cycle.
FlightRoutes => Dijsktra but.. 10 distances
RoundTripII => Cyclefinding - DFS in directed graph. 
CourseSchedule => Topological Sort.
LongestFlightRoute => Topological Sort.
GameRoutes => toposort + DP
Investigation => another dijkstra
Planet QueriesI => sparse table
Planet QueriesII => sparse table + some arrays of infos.
PlanetCycles => floyd cycle finding + some DFS
RoadReparation => Kruskal MST
RoadConstruction => DSU
FlightRoutesCheck => DFS transpose graph
PlanetsAndKingdoms => SCC Tarjan

Download Speed => Max flow
Police Chase => Min Cut
School Dance => Maximum matching
Distinct Routes => Edge-disjoint paths.
